# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

# What Happened Here?

Whilst on a bootcamp that specialised in DevOps Engineering, I learnt how to use Python and produce projects.
This project was one of many that was made during the bootcamp.

1. Clone repository
2. Use terminal to navigate to hangman.py
